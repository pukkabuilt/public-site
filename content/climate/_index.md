I have spent years feeling a lot of doom and despair about the impending climate crisis we have in front of us.
It has become clear to me that work in climate action addresses the existential and urgent question of our generation,
and I want to play a part in it. It is time to leave doom and despair behind,
and instead recognize that the gravity of the situation underwrites the size of the opportunity that we have ahead.

I am currently interested in increasing the capacity of long distace transmission lines through software rather than needing to build more physical infrastructure (although that would be great too!), and geothermal energy.
